# User Module

This document outlines the API endpoints and services responsible for retrieving user data. The `User` model acts as the core identity record (created during wallet authentication).

All endpoints in the User module are protected and require a valid JWT token.

---

## Automatic Username Generation

When a new user signs in for the first time (or any authenticated user is found to have a `null` username), the backend automatically assigns a random display username.

**Format:** `Crypto_<first6charsOfWallet>_<4-char alphanumeric suffix>`

**Example:** `Crypto_5Bpd2v_x3kQ`

Users can later update this username via the `PATCH /user/me/username` endpoint.

---

## Get User Profile (`GET /user/me`)

Retrieves the full profile of the currently authenticated user, including wallet address, points, SKR tokens, level, and progression stats.

### Requirements

- **Authentication**: Required (`Bearer Token`)

### Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Successful Response (`200 OK`)

## Get User Points (`GET /user/me/points`)

Retrieves only the total accumulated `points` for the currently authenticated user. This is a lightweight endpoint optimal for frequent UI polling.

### Requirements

- **Authentication**: Required (`Bearer Token`)

### Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Successful Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "points": 1500
  }
}
```

---

## Get User Tokens (`GET /user/me/tokens`)

Retrieves only the total accumulated `$SKR` tokens for the currently authenticated user.

### Requirements

- **Authentication**: Required (`Bearer Token`)

### Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Successful Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "skrTokens": 250
  }
}
```

---

## Get User Level Progress (`GET /user/me/progress`)

Returns the user's current level and a breakdown of their progress towards the next level, computed from the total number of correct answers.

### Requirements

- **Authentication**: Required (`Bearer Token`)

### How the formula works

Questions required to advance from level N to level N+1:

```
questionsToNextLevel(N) = N × 10
```

| Current Level | Questions needed to advance |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- |
| 1             | 10                          |
| 2             | 20                          |
| 3             | 30                          |
| N             | N × 10                     |

Each time `POST /game/add-to-user-points` is called (correct answer recorded), the backend automatically increments `questionsAnswered` and recalculates `level`.

### Successful Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "level": 2,
    "questionsAnswered": 15,
    "answeredTowardsNextLevel": 5,
    "requiredForNextLevel": 20
  }
}
```

| Field                        | Description                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `level`                    | Current level of the user                                       |
| `questionsAnswered`        | Total correct questions answered all-time                       |
| `answeredTowardsNextLevel` | Questions answered within the current level tier                |
| `requiredForNextLevel`     | Total questions needed to complete the current tier and advance |

---

## Withdraw SKR Tokens (`POST /user/me/withdraw`)

Deducts the specified amount of `$SKR` tokens from the user's in-app balance and transfers the equivalent SPL tokens from the backend treasury wallet to the user's Solana wallet on devnet.

The backend treasury signs and pays for the transaction — the user does not need any SOL in their wallet.

### Requirements

- **Authentication**: Required (`Bearer Token`)

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "amount": 50
}
```

| Field      | Type       | Rules                                                                                                                 |
| :--------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `amount` | `number` | Required · positive number (floats allowed, e.g.`0.5`) · must not exceed the user's current `skrTokens` balance |

### Successful Response (`200 OK`)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "txSignature": "5KtBh...7xQmR",
    "amount": 50
  }
}
```

| Field           | Description                                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `txSignature` | Solana transaction signature — verifiable on[Solana Explorer (devnet)](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) |
| `amount`      | Number of SKR tokens withdrawn                                                                                    |

### How it works

1. The endpoint atomically checks that the user has `>= amount` tokens and deducts them in a single DB operation — preventing race conditions.
2. The treasury wallet sends an SPL token transfer on devnet to the user's wallet address (stored on their account from sign-in).
3. If the on-chain transfer fails for any reason, the DB deduction is automatically rolled back and the user's balance is restored.
4. The user's Associated Token Account (ATA) is created automatically by the treasury if it doesn't already exist.

### Withdraw-Specific Errors

| Status                      | Reason                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `400 Bad Request`         | `amount` is not a positive number, or the user has insufficient `skrTokens` balance |
| `401 Unauthorized`        | Missing or invalid JWT                                                                  |
| `502 Bad Gateway`         | On-chain SPL transfer failed (balance is automatically restored)                        |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | Treasury wallet or SKR mint address is not configured on the server                     |

## Error Responses

For all the routes in the User module, the following errors may be encountered:

#### Unauthorized Error (`401 Unauthorized`)

Returned if the request lacks a valid JWT or if the token has expired/is malformed.

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "No token provided" // or "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

#### Not Found Error (`500 Internal Server Error`)

Returned if the JWT payload is valid, but the user ID extracted from it no longer exists in the MongoDB database (e.g., if the user was manually deleted).

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "User not found"
}
```

---

## User Service Layer (`src/user/user.service.ts`)

The raw logic handling the database interaction relies on Mongoose's `Model.findById()`.

### `UserService.getUserDetails(userId: string)`

Fetches and returns the entire user document. Overrides any implicit `.select()` restrictions, excluding standard ignored fields like `__v` and mapping `_id` to `id` through the schema's JSON transformer.

### `UserService.getUserPoints(userId: string)`

Optimized query using `.select('points')`. Returns only the points field to minimize database and network overhead.

### `UserService.getUserTokens(userId: string)`

Optimized query using `.select('skrTokens')`. Returns only the tokens field to minimize overhead.

### `UserService.updateUsername(userId: string, newUsername: string)`

Validates that `newUsername` is non-empty and 3–30 characters long, then checks for an existing user with the same username (case-insensitive). On success, updates the document via `findByIdAndUpdate` and returns the full updated user.
